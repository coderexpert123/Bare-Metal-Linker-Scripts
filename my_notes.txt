 code (instruction) - flash memory ROM 
 data -  RAM (Read and write ) , data is nothing but var it can change anytime
 that why stored in RAM 


.data -- contain intilized data 
.rodata -- contain read only data
.bss -- contain data which is unintilized

 contain some special data 


1.Now .o creted of led and main program 

2.Linker and locator combile all section of bothe the .o file 

3.Storage of final executable in code memeory [ROM and Flash]

4. Code Flash memeory section 
unused code meoery 
.data
.rowdata 
.text
vector table 

5.copied code .data section Flash (Code memoery)  to SRAM(Data Memoey )

6.Type of Data 

a)global unint data
b)local uninit data
c)global init data
d)local init data
e)local unint static  data
f)global unit static data
g)global init static data
h)local inint static data 

7.unitize goes to .bss and init goes to .data section , we can define this in ours
startup file and also need to defined boundries from where .bss start and end 

8.Write startuo ile for Target
